## Abstract
This is the template engine for JuliaLang.
features
- Very very small! There are no dependency.
- You can write a Julia code directly in HTML.

## Why Jinja?
The reason is that it's the same as jinja2 for Python, the template is similar to temple
Actually , the temple is a "Otera" in Japanese, and the Jinja is a shrine. But I can't merge automatically with Otera.jl, so I chose Jinja.jl.
